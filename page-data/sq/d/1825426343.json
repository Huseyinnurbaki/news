Our hacks give you access to a wide range of parameters that you get to fully customize to your liking. Our intent is to allow you to further humanize various functions of the Valorant cheat, such as the aimbot smoothness, bones, FOV, and so forth. However, you can turn them all the way up and send your opponents packing in full-rage mode.  Keep in mind that while rage settings are fun to mess with, and despite the fact that our cheat is undetected by the Valorant anti-cheat - it's still possible to get banned for using rage settings via a player report or spectator review. As such, we recommend that you follow our guides and set up your hacks to be as humanized as possible.
