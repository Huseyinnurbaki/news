Our hacks give you access to a wide range of parameters that you get to fully customize to your liking. Our intent is to allow you to further humanize various functions of the Valorant cheat, such as the aimbot smoothness, bones, FOV, and so forth. However, you can turn them all the way up and send your opponents packing in full-rage mode.  Keep in mind that while rage settings are fun to mess with, and despite the fact that our cheat is undetected by the Valorant anti-cheat - it's still possible to get banned for using rage settings via a player report or spectator review. As such, we recommend that you follow our guides and set up your hacks to be as humanized as possible.

Check the provided Injection.h header for more information. Make sure you have the compiled binaries in the working directory of your program. On first run the injection module has to download PDB files for the native (and when run on x64 the wow64) version of the ntdll.dll to resolve symbol addresses. Use the exported StartDownload function to begin the download. The injector can only function if the downloads are finished. The injection module exports GetSymbolState and GetImportState which will return INJ_ERROR_SUCCESS (0) if the PDB download and resolving of all required addresses is completed. Additionally GetDownloadProgress can be used to determine the progress of the download as percentage. If the injection module is to be unloaded during the download process call InterruptDownload or there's a chance that the dll will deadlock your process.","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":3,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106281261?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/caxsi","login":"caxsi"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/caxsi/DLLSyringe-Injector-V2-Valorant-Warzone-Rust-Apex-Legends.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:caxsi/DLLSyringe-Injector-V2-Valorant-Warzone-Rust-Apex-Legends.git"},{"full_name":"de-id/transformers-papers","git_url":"git://github.com/de-id/transformers-papers.git","html_url":"https://github.com/de-id/transformers-papers","name":"transformers-papers","stargazers_count":5,"created_at":"11 hours ago","description":"Papers club from the AI team in D-ID  - this time transformers from attention to vision [Hebrew | עיברית]","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":5,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87980430?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/de-id","login":"de-id"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/de-id/transformers-papers.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:de-id/transformers-papers.git"},{"full_name":"caxsi/Hwid-Spoofer-Game-Anticheat-Cleaners-Unban-Any-Games-Drivers","git_url":"git://github.com/caxsi/Hwid-Spoofer-Game-Anticheat-Cleaners-Unban-Any-Games-Drivers.git","html_url":"https://github.com/caxsi/Hwid-Spoofer-Game-Anticheat-Cleaners-Unban-Any-Games-Drivers","name":"Hwid-Spoofer-Game-Anticheat-Cleaners-Unban-Any-Games-Drivers","stargazers_count":3,"created_at":"3 hours ago","description":"Network Physical MAC Address Virtual Mac Address Adapter GUID Disk SCSI SerialNumber NVME SerialNumber SATA SerialNumber Volume SerialNumber Smbios Bios SerialNumber Baseboard SerialNumber Chassis SerialNumber System SerialNumber System UUID Processor ProcessorId Misc GPU UUID Monitor SerialNumber Registry Identifiers is a Universal HWID Spoofer operating in Ring 0 machine privilege level to spoof your machine serials Scanned by common games and their anti-cheat supporters such as; Battleye / EasyAntiCheat / Ricochet and other anti-cheat providers.","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":3,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106281261?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/caxsi","login":"caxsi"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/caxsi/Hwid-Spoofer-Game-Anticheat-Cleaners-Unban-Any-Games-Drivers.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:caxsi/Hwid-Spoofer-Game-Anticheat-Cleaners-Unban-Any-Games-Drivers.git"},{"full_name":"Marklose/web-Bigevents-project","git_url":"git://github.com/Marklose/web-Bigevents-project.git","html_url":"https://github.com/Marklose/web-Bigevents-project","name":"web-Bigevents-project","stargazers_count":3,"created_at":"16 hours ago","description":"大事件项目","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":3,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106230852?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/Marklose","login":"Marklose"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/Marklose/web-Bigevents-project.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:Marklose/web-Bigevents-project.git"},{"full_name":"caxsi/GameWear-Hwid-Spoofer-Source-Code","git_url":"git://github.com/caxsi/GameWear-Hwid-Spoofer-Source-Code.git","html_url":"https://github.com/caxsi/GameWear-Hwid-Spoofer-Source-Code","name":"GameWear-Hwid-Spoofer-Source-Code","stargazers_count":3,"created_at":"3 hours ago","description":"Windows Version?
