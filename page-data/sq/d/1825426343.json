Assemble and validate complex logical statements. 2. Categorize data into distinctive sets and manipulate sets in relation to one another. 3. Prove mathematical statements through the usage of direct and indirect methodologies. 4. Convert data from one form to another, perform operations upon the converted data, and  return it to its previous form. 5. Introduce additional information into transmitted data for the purpose of error-checking. 6. Connect sets of data with relational operations and define the nature of those relations. 7. Manipulate and systematically analyze graphs and trees. 8. Utilize graphs and trees to represent data and optimize algorithms. 9. Use matrix operations to perform error-checking, path-finding, and schedule-optimization  tasks. 10. Recognize and rank algorithms in terms of their relative complexities. 11. Determine probabilities through the creation of various permutations and combinations. 12. How to encrypt and decrypt data.
