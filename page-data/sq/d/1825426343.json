Since there are many point-selecting schemes, the time complexity of the exhaustive method is too high, so the heuristic search scheme is adopted. Genetic algorithm is a heuristic search method that imitates the natural genetic mechanism. It has high efficiency in solving such problems and can obtain an approximate solution of an optimal solution. In this paper, the genetic algorithm is used as the optimization algorithm, and the simulated annealing algorithm is used as an extension. The cubic spline interpolation method is used to find the optimal solution.","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72972560?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingSaint1984","login":"CodingSaint1984"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/CodingSaint1984/Calibration-Scheme-of-the-Temperature-Sensor.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:CodingSaint1984/Calibration-Scheme-of-the-Temperature-Sensor.git"},{"full_name":"odh-labs/ml-workshop","git_url":"git://github.com/odh-labs/ml-workshop.git","html_url":"https://github.com/odh-labs/ml-workshop","name":"ml-workshop","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"2 hours ago","description":"Open Data Hub Machine Learning Workshop","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103393748?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/odh-labs","login":"odh-labs"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/odh-labs/ml-workshop.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:odh-labs/ml-workshop.git"},{"full_name":"JacobHelton57/JobAppsAPI","git_url":"git://github.com/JacobHelton57/JobAppsAPI.git","html_url":"https://github.com/JacobHelton57/JobAppsAPI","name":"JobAppsAPI","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"an hour ago","description":null,"forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24308669?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/JacobHelton57","login":"JacobHelton57"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/JacobHelton57/JobAppsAPI.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:JacobHelton57/JobAppsAPI.git"},{"full_name":"yangfengzzz/DigitalVox5","git_url":"git://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox5.git","html_url":"https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox5","name":"DigitalVox5","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"2 hours ago","description":null,"forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378042?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/yangfengzzz","login":"yangfengzzz"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/yangfengzzz/DigitalVox5.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:yangfengzzz/DigitalVox5.git"},{"full_name":"avspinelli/Covid-19-Impact-on-the-NYC-Rental-Market","git_url":"git://github.com/avspinelli/Covid-19-Impact-on-the-NYC-Rental-Market.git","html_url":"https://github.com/avspinelli/Covid-19-Impact-on-the-NYC-Rental-Market","name":"Covid-19-Impact-on-the-NYC-Rental-Market","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"2 hours ago","description":"Visualizations, descriptions, and overview of the Covid 19 Impact on the NYC Rental Market working paper","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72222680?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/avspinelli","login":"avspinelli"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/avspinelli/Covid-19-Impact-on-the-NYC-Rental-Market.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:avspinelli/Covid-19-Impact-on-the-NYC-Rental-Market.git"},{"full_name":"jkilfoy/agario-javafx","git_url":"git://github.com/jkilfoy/agario-javafx.git","html_url":"https://github.com/jkilfoy/agario-javafx","name":"agario-javafx","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"2 hours ago","description":"Clone of agario for JavaFX","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23486537?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/jkilfoy","login":"jkilfoy"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/jkilfoy/agario-javafx.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:jkilfoy/agario-javafx.git"},{"full_name":"Bigearkk/Supplementary","git_url":"git://github.com/Bigearkk/Supplementary.git","html_url":"https://github.com/Bigearkk/Supplementary","name":"Supplementary","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"an hour ago","description":null,"forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93217551?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/Bigearkk","login":"Bigearkk"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/Bigearkk/Supplementary.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:Bigearkk/Supplementary.git"},{"full_name":"andykswong/munum-rs","git_url":"git://github.com/andykswong/munum-rs.git","html_url":"https://github.com/andykswong/munum-rs","name":"munum-rs","stargazers_count":1,"created_at":"an hour ago","description":"Rust Micro Library for 3D Math","forks_count":0,"watchers_count":1,"owner":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8017699?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/andykswong","login":"andykswong"},"clone_url":"https://github.com/andykswong/munum-rs.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:andykswong/munum-rs.git"}]}}}
